<h1>32x32 Systolic Array RTL + Firmware Project</h1>

<p>
  Currently, the repository name is 3x3 [...] but this is really a bigger one at 8x8.
  However, the implementation does not only end at an 8x8 since this can be "tiled" and be extended to a 32x32 systolic array. 
  The implementation is from the bottom up hence I am starting with a small tile going up to a bigger tile.
  Controller implementation would be done soon.

  The firmware is planned to be written using Xilinx' Vitis program. This should interface the PS and the PL parts of the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 board that I have. I can also extend this to connect my Raspberry Pi 4 
  but that should be for the future.
